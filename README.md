# Hello! This is my BlackJack Casino Game Project. :)
# General Description
This project is a simplified version of the well-known casino card game, Blackjack, developed in C++. The program enables players to compete against the dealer utilizing a single deck of 52 cards. It offers features to showcase both the dealer's and player's hands, calculate winning odds, and simulate hitting a card. The objective is to deliver an engaging and authentic Blackjack experience.
# Programming Approaches
1) Object-Oriented Design: The project utilizes classes and structures to create and model the game components, such as cards, deck, and hands. This approach promotes modularity, extensibility, and code organization.
2) Simulation: The software replicates the game by computing winning probabilities via numerous iterations using a shuffled deck. This approach provides statistical estimates of the likelihood of winning.
3) Pseudorandom Shuffling: The program employs a pseudorandom shuffling algorithm to make sure that card distribution and gameplay is fair.
